Our app works by first capturing the face of the students so that it can verify that the students are filling the attendance themselves.
Then the teacher will display 4 qr codes out of which minimum 3 successful scans are needed for the attendance.
Each qr code will stay for 5 seconds and because students need atleast 3 qr codes so even if someone tries to share the qr code with someone else outside the class they can share only 1 qr code as they ll need to scan other three themselves and even if first and last qr codes are shared the minimum 3 qr codes requirement would never be filled.
This process is not only very fast but also quite effective in eliminating the loopholes in the current attendance taking methods.
